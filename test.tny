"This is a simple factorial program, written in TinyLang. It demonstrates 
that TinyLang can take input, produce output, and have infiitely complex 
control flow. Also, that it has comments, which are just string literals that
are not printed out."

a: 1
b: 1
sum: 0

n?
while i < n or i = n {
    sum: a+b
    a: b
    b: sum
    i: i + 1
    sum!
